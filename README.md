# CMPUT 201 Notes

## Disclaimer

This course by the U of A was taken during the 2020 quarantine and therefore may not be a true representation of a normal 201 class. People from previous years have claimed that topics such as dp (dynamic programming), greedy, graphs, and others were explored but Dr. Lin Guo-Hui did not really explore these topics.  

## General

This course is an intro to C. From pointers to make files, this course will develop an intuition for c programming (C++ is almost not taught, for C++ take 275). 



Course difficulty: Easy-medium
